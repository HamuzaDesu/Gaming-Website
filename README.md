# Gaming-Website

Just a simple website i made to get used to using Bootstrap, CSS, Javascript and API requests.

It's quite buggy on Github Pages with the API requests and idk how to fix it so if you want to see the full thing clone this repo and run index.html on your local machine.

The (non-working) website can be seen [here](https://hamuzadesu.github.io/Gaming-Website/)
